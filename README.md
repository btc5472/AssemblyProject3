# AssemblyProject3
This program was written in the ARMSim simulation program. The ARMSim program simulates an ARM processor and allows you to write programs for it. It was designed for educational purposes. ARMSim also comes with a virtualized LED display and a 16 key number pad that your program can interact with. So my program for this project was designed for that virtualized ARMSim LED display and number keypad. My program starts with the number 1000 displayed on the display and subtracts the number from 1000 that corresponds to each keypad button. There are two black buttons that reset the system at any time. A forced reset is required if the number reaches 0. The ARMSimScreenshot.png shows what the virtualized keypad and display environment would have looked like more or less.
